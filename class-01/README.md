# Class 1

## program execution
http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=display

* vars and functions are hoisted
* functions create new scopes, Global scope
* outer scopes can't touch inner ones, but inner ones can touch outer ones
* shadowing
* functions, loops, ifs, cause execution order to not be line by line


## higher order functions again
* the most important, callback functions

## the bugs

* priorities can become negative
* you can have priorities with the same value (to fix this we may want to change
  the ui a little bit)
